Problem Statement

People consume media across multiple platforms including movies, television, and video games, but there is no centralized system to track what they want to watch or 
play, what they are currently engaging with, and what they have completed. Existing tools are fragmented, limited to one type of media, and do not provide a unified 
way to track progress, add personal notes, or analyze viewing habits over time.

Proposed Solution:
Develop a Unified Media Backlog and Discovery Platform, a web-based application that allows users to manage a personal media backlog, track progress, record ratings 
and reflections, and discover new content via external media APIs. The system will provide a centralized, user-friendly experience while demonstrating enterprise 
Java development principles including authentication, persistence with Hibernate and JPA, RESTful API integration, layered architecture, logging, and automated testing.
